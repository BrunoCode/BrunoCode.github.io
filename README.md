# What I have been up to recently

I plan on writing decending sorted notes about my current endeavors. These notes help me keep a record of my progress toward my small and large goals.
My current medium sized goal is to get good at leetcode/hackerank style interview questions. This is likely the first step in any job interview. 
Thanks for reading.

Today I worked on breaking down the intuition behind the two sum problem on a sorted integer array. This is a simple problem that anyone could eventually intuitively solve. I wanted to focus on clearly defining what that intuition was. I believe this is an important aspect of critical thinking. Reflecting on the intuition behind these problems will help us develop a comstrategy to tackle future coding problems.
